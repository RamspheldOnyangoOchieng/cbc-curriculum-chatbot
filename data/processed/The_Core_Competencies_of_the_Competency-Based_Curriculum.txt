The Competency -Based Curriculum (CBC) in Kenya has emerged as ground -breaking in the 
education sector. It introduced a fresh perspective on how students acquire knowledge and 
skills, placing a strong emphasis on core competencies. These core values have become pivotal 
in shaping our learners' characters.  
The core competencies in the CBC encompass a set of skills and attributes that students are 
expected to acquire during their educational journey. These values go beyond traditional subject -based learning and focus on holistic development. They include critical thinking, 
creativity, communication, collaboration, digital literacy and lifelong learning.  
The Benefits of Core Competencies in CBC  
The implementation of core competencies in CBC offers a plethora of advantages to learners. These competencies provide a more comprehensive and well- rounded education that prepares 
learners for the complexities of the real world. Here are some of the key b enefits:  
1. Holistic Development  
CBC's core competencies foster holistic development by emphasising skills that are essential not only in academics but also in life. This allows learners to become well- rounded 
individuals at school and at home.  
2. Problem- Solving  
Learners learn critical thinking skills, enabling them to analyse problems and find innovative 
solutions. Parents can help their children improve these skills by assisting them in figuring 
out how to manage their time between homework, play time, chores and other activities.  
3. Communication  
Effective communication is a cornerstone of success. CBC emphasises strong communication skills, which are valuable in all aspects of life.  
4. Collaboration  
Learners are encouraged to work together, promoting teamwork and cooperation. This is a lifelong skill a child can carry with them into adulthood.  
5. Digital Literacy 
In today's technology -driven world, digital literacy is a must. CBC equips students with these 
essential skills.  
6. Lifelong Learning  
With a focus on lifelong learning, CBC instils the value of continuous education and self-
improvement.  
The Role of Competency -Based Assessment  
In the CBC, assessment methods are designed to measure a student's understanding  of core 
competencies. These assessments differ from traditional exams in that they focus on real -world 
applications of knowledge and skills. Competency -based assessment includes project -based 
assignments, practical demonstrations and continuous evaluations. The following are a few benefits of competency -based assessment:  
1. Individualised Learning  
Assessment in CBC is tailored to individual progress, allowing students to advance at their own pace.  
2. Reduced Exam Stress  
The elimination of high -pressure exams reduces stress levels and promotes a more relaxed 
learning environment.  
3. Skill Mastery  
Competency -based assessment ensures that students truly master the core competencies, 
rather than simply memorising information for exams.  
Parental Involvement and Support in the Competency -Based Curriculum  
Parents play an important role in a learner's educational journey, especially in a competency -
based curriculum. Their involvement and support can make a significant difference in a child's development.  
• Understanding the Curriculum: Parents should familiarise themselves with the CBC, its core values, and the assessment methods. This knowledge enables them to support their children effectively.  
• Encouragement and Motivation: Parents can motivate their children by showing interest in their progress, praising their efforts and providing encouragement.  
• Engaging with Teachers: Communication with teachers and school staff can help parents stay informed about their child's progress and any areas that may need improvement.  
• Creating a Supportive Environment: A nurturing home environment that encourages critical thinking, creativity, and effective communication complements the CBC's goals.  
• Balancing Extracurricular Activities: While the CBC emphasises core competencies, a 
well- rounded education includes extracurricular activities. Parents can help students 
strike a balance.  
A modern education requires modern approaches. That is why parents and teachers must work 
together to help learners thrive under the competency -based curriculum.
