CBC or Cambridge: Choosing the Best Curriculum for Your Child  
Most parents in Kenya grapple with the choice of selecting the right educational path for our children.  
Currently , two prominent options that stand out in the country are competency -based curriculum  
(CBC)  and the Cambridge curriculum.  Both approaches have their merits, but ﬁnding the best ﬁt for 
your child requires careful consideration.  
There exists a prevailing misconception that students who pursue international curricula are inherently 
destined for success, gaining admission to prestigious universities abroad and achieving prosperous 
careers. Conversely, it is often believed that students following the national curriculum face an uphill 
battle, with limited prospects for success due to perceived limitations of the national curriculum. 
However, these notions are misguided, as the well -known adage states, "all roads lead to Rome." 
Therefo re, parents need not be unduly concerned about the choice of curriculum for their children, as 
both pathways can lead to success.  
A closer look at  these two curricula may  provide further guidance to help parents make an informed 
decision that caters to their child's unique needs.  
The Competency -Based Curriculum (CBC) places a strong emphasis on the mastery of speciﬁc skills and 
knowledge, adopting a student -centered approach that fosters personalized learning experiences and 
addresses individual strengths and weaknesses. This curr iculum allows students to progress at their 
own pace, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of concepts before advancing. By nurturing critical thinking, problem -solving abilities, and practical skills applicable to real- world situations, CBC equips 
stude nts with the tools necessary for success in the modern workforce. Its beneﬁts include tailored 
learning experiences that promote individual growth, the ability for students to delve deeper into 
subjects at their own pace, integration of real -world applica tions, and a focus on mastery of skills and 
knowledge.  
On the other hand, the Cambridge Curriculum holds global recognition and oﬀers a structured and 
comprehensive program encompassing a broad range of subjects and assessments. Designed to 
develop students' intellectual, social, and emotional skills, it prep ares them for future educational 
endeavors and employment opportunities. The advantages of the Cambridge Curriculum include providing a globally recognized benchmark that facilitates international mobility, a rigorous 
assessment system that provides a robu st evaluation of a student's academic progress, a diverse range 
of subjects allowing learners to explore multiple disciplines and discover their passions, as well as a 
strong emphasis on higher -order thinking skills to foster intellectual growth and analyti cal abilities.  
When selecting the best curriculum for your child, it is crucial to understand their learning style and assess their strengths, weaknesses, and preferences. Consider their preferred mode of learning, 
whether they thrive in a structured environment or prefe r more ﬂexibility. Evaluating their long -term 
goals is also essential. Reﬂect on your child's aspirations and future educational or career paths, and 
consider which curriculum aligns better with their goals and provides appropriate qualiﬁcations or 
certi ﬁcations. Additionally, take into account your child's individual needs, such as special education 
requirements or speciﬁc extracurricular interests, and evaluate how each curriculum accommodates 
these needs.  
Seeking input from educators is vital as well. Consult with teachers, academic advisors, and school administrators who are familiar with your child's learning style. Their insights can provide valuable 
guidance in the decision -making process. Furthermore, visiting schools that implement diﬀerent 
curricula and engaging with parents whose children are enrolled in those programs can oﬀer ﬁrsthand 
insights into the strengths and limitations of each curriculum. By considering these factors and 
gathering relevant information, parents can make a well- informed choice that maximizes their child's 
educational experience . 
At Makini Schools, we are proud to oﬀer both the CBC  and the Cambridge curriculum, recognizing the 
value of providing diverse educational options to meet the unique needs of every child . We believe 
that true academic excellence lies in understanding that each learner is an individual with distinct 
talents, interests, and aspirations. By oﬀering both curricula, we empower parents to make informed 
decisions based on their child's learning  style, future goals, and academic preferences. Our 
commitment to acad emic excellence extends beyond mere options; we prioritize a holistic approach 
that combines the best elements of both curricula, fostering personalized learning, critical thinking, 
and real -world application  within a rigorous academic framework. At Makini Schools, we strive to 
create an educational environment that inspires innovation, nurtures individual potential, and equips 
students with the skills and knowledge they need to thrive in an ever -changing glob al landscape.  
In choosing between competency -based curriculum and the Cambridge curriculum, there is no one -
size-ﬁts-all approach. Every child is unique, and their educational journey should reﬂect that. 
Ultimately, the key lies in ﬁnding an educational approach that nurtures their strengths, stimulates their curiosity, and equips them with the skills and knowledge necessary to thrive.
