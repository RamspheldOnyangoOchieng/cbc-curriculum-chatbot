THE CBC EDUCATION SYSTEM IN KENYA  
The Competency Based Curriculum (CBC) education system is an adjustment from the 
previous 8 -4-4 system that has been in practice since 1985. The CBC system was implemented 
in 2017 and focuses on each students abilities and strengths  rather than the 8 -4-4 system that 
was more exam based. In the CBC system students still learn the subjects that were taught in 
the 8-4-4 system but more practical skills have been in-cooperated to help  propel them towards 
a career path that is more aligned with their strengths.
