 FOREWORD  
Parents are the first and continuing educators of their children. They have a 
shared responsibility with schools to provide an enabling environment that 
is conducive to learning and which motivates child ren to achieve their ful l 
potential. There is great need therefore to build effective partnerships 
between parents, the community and schools to support children’s learning for improved learning outcomes.  
 
According to the Basic Education Curriculum Framework (BECF), the Kenya 
Institute of Curriculum Development (KICD )is expected to provide 
guidance on strategies that learning institutions can adopt to empower and 
engage parents so that they can effectively and consistently contribute to the learning outcomes of their children at all levels of Basic Education.  
 
Parental Empowerment and Engagement (PE&E) is essential to the 
improvement of learners’ holistic development including academic performance. Empowered and engaged parents have a positive impact on 
the overall development of  the learner in areas such as acquisition and 
nurturing of moral and religious values, improved health and nutrition, 
increased enrolment, retention, transition, academic achievements and identification of appropriate career choice.  
 KICD in its endeavor to ensure that parents play a key role in education and 
training has developed Guidelines on PE&E . The Guidelines provide 
strategies on how learning institutions  can empower parents and create an 
enabling environment so that parents are fully involved in  their child ren’s 
learning  as well as in  the education sector.

 SECTION 1 
1.0 INTRODUCTION TO THE GUIDELINES ON PARENTAL 
EMPOWERMENT AND ENGAGEMENT  
Parents play an important role in the holistic growth and development of 
a child. In the traditional society, the extende d family and community 
played a pivotal role in the education of the children. However, in the 
contemporary society the scenario has changed. Many parents are less 
involved in parenting and learning processes of their children due to a 
number of reasons su ch as changes in family structure, economic changes 
where parents have to work sometimes away from home, technological advancement where social media strongly influences the values and behaviours of family members.  
 The role of education is to impart rele vant knowledge, skills, attitudes 
and values that will enable an individual to be a productive member of 
the society. Parents are the first educators, trainers and source of 
authority that a child interacts with. Empowerment and engagement of 
parents to sk illfully identify a child’s talent and potential, creates an 
enabling environment for the school to build on. The Guidelines on 
PE&E are therefore designed as a tool that can  aid learning i nstitutions to 
strengthen parents’  capacity in parenting and involv ement in the 
education of their children.  
 
1.1 Rationale for the Guidelines on PE&E   
Parental Empowerment and Engagement (PE&E) is one of the guiding 
principles of the BECF. The principle undersc ores the critical role that 
parents play towards the success of their children’s education. The 
Guidelines are intended to provide mechanisms for enhancing the capacity, skills and drive for action as well as providing avenues for parental involvement. The  main aim of the Guidelines is to enhance the 
parent’s role in nurturing the leaner’s potential.

 1.2  Vision and Mission Statements of PE&E  
Parental Empowerment and Engagement  (PE&E) in  the educational  
process shall be guided by the following vision and mission:  
 
Vision: “Enhanced parental engagement in learner’s education‛  
Mission: “ To strengthen parental involvement in nurturing the learner’s 
potential‛.   
The Vision and Mission statements of the Guid elines on PE&E are 
aimed at supporting the attainment of CBC’s Vision statement, which is 
to have ‚An Engaged, Empowered and Ethical Citizen‛. Empowered 
and engaged parents will support the desire to ‘Nurture Every Learner’s Potential’.  
PE &E Guidelines a re anchored in the existing legal frameworks and 
policies, which  include:  
 
a) The Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC -1990)  
The Convention lays the foundational principles from which all rights 
are derived. Helping children to understand their rights  will require 
parents to guide them to make choices with knowledge of 
accompanying consequences.  These principles require children to respect the rights of others, especially their parents. Rights of children should be respected by  all educational stakeho lders.  
 
b) The African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child (1999)  
The Children's Charter originated because the member states of the 
African Union believed that the CRC missed important socio -cultural 
and economic realities particular to Africa. I t emphasizes the need to 
include African cultural values and experiences when dealing with 
the rights of the child.  
 
c) The Constitution of Kenya (CoK 2010)  
The Constitution of Kenya in Article 26 recognizes the dignity and 
sanctity of life by acknowledging t he right to life. Article 45 then 
goes on to acknowledge the family as a fundamental unit of society 
and the necessary basis of social order.  
3 
 Article 53 is premised on the provisions of the CRC and the African charter.  
It states that a child is entitled t o:   
  A name, nationality, basic education, nutrition, shelter and healthcare.  
 Protection from abuse, neglect, harmful cultural practices, all forms of violence as well as exploitative labour.   
 Provision from both parents whether married or not.  
 
d) Basic E ducation Act, 2013  
According to the Basic Education Act, 2013, Article 31 (3) indicates that a parent or guardian has a right to participate in the character development of their children. This fosters good habits, acceptable values and behaviour for effec tive living as an individual member of the 
society.  
 
e) The Sessional Paper No.1 of 2019 on Reforming Education and 
Training  
The Sessional paper states that a child’s school life should be enriched to 
enable him or her experience and cope better with life.  
 
f) Basic Education Curriculum Framework (BECF -2016)  
The BECF is a product of extensive stakeholder interactions, needs assessment and benchmarking studies. In a nutshell, the BECF captures the aspirations of most Kenyans in relation to the provision of Basic and 
Teacher Education in the country. The BECF has identified PE&E as one of the critical components of the competency based curriculum. The 
Guidelines on PE&E have been developed to actualize this aspiration. 
The Guidelines will support the realization of  learning outcomes by 
enhancing the capacity of curriculum implementers. Indeed, teachers require the right skills to enable them create and streng then 
partnerships with parents.   
1.3 Guiding Principles on Parental  Empowerment and Engagement  
Parental Empowerment and Engagement (PE&E) is based on four guiding principles.

1.3 Guiding Principles on Parental  Empowerment and Engagement  
Parental Empowerment and Engagement (PE&E) is based on four guiding principles.  
 
3
4 
 These principles  are:  
1.3.1 Inclusivity   
Parents should be represented and actively engaged in all relevant  
decision- making  levels in schools. It also entails participation in 
governance and advocacy through school councils and committees. 
Inclusivity can be fostered through effective communication o n 
school programmes and learne rs’ progress to parents.  
1.3.2  Values   
The primary responsibility for nurturing values  rests with parents 
and the community, but education too has an important role to play 
in this regard. Parents should instill values tha t guide learners in 
making right, moral and ethical choices in life, choices that will 
positively influen ce other people in the society.  
1.3.3 Shared Responsibility    
Parental empowerment and engagement consi sts of partnerships 
between parents, schools and communities. It involves raising the awareness of parents on the benefits of engaging in their children’s education and providing them with skills to do so.  
1.3.4 Prudent use of resources   
Awareness on the need for proper utilization and maintenance of resources will be created among parents, school administrators, 
teachers and learners. They should be encouraged to develop 
methods of prudent resource manage ment. This will foster positive 
attitudes in the use of the physical facilities provided in learning institutions. Parents can also be the resources or providers of resources required for use in learning institutions.  
1.4 Theoretical Approaches  
A number of theories recognize the role of parents in the enhancement of learning outcomes among learners.  Some of the 
theoretical foundations for PE&E include but are not limited to:  
5 
 1.4.1 Psychoanalysis and Personali ty Development  
Theories (Sigmund Freud and Erik Erikson)  
According to Freud and Erickson, personality and behaviour develop 
through a series of stages. The emotional experiences of early 
childhood have a profound impact on adult personality. Hence, parents must shield their children from painful experiences, during 
the formative years.  Unless this is done, the end result might be a 
psychologicall y imbalanced person.  
1.4.2 Attachment Theories (Bowlby/Mary Ainsworth/Harlow/Konrand ) 
These theories focus on the need for children to bond emotionally with significant per sons in their lives.  Consequently, parents must 
extend love, a sense of belonging, warmth and predictable care that meet the physiological and psychological needs of children. Only then, can positive results be achieved.  
1.4.3 Cognitive and Intellectual D evelopment Theories (Jean Piaget and 
Lev Vygotsky)  
This theory postulates that intellectual abilities are determined by a child’s genetic inheritance a nd nurtured by environmental conditions. 
So, parents must be empowered to enable them provide enriched environments for children’s intellectual growth.  
 
1.4.4 Behaviour Modification Theories (Ivan Pavlov, J. B. Watson and B.  
F. Skinner)  
These theories suggest that, behaviour can be modified through the way the environment is arranged, for example, pairing experiences that lead to association learning, re inforcement leading to acquisition 
of behaviours, punishment leading to weakening or elimination of behaviours, among others. Therefore, parents should realise that their power to mould children’s behavior is of great importance.

 SECTION 2 
2.0 PILLARS AND STRATEGIES ON PARENTAL EMPOWERMENT 
AND ENGAGEMENT  
2.1 Introduction   
This section provides infor mation on the pillars  and the strategies  that 
support PE &E. Each strategy  has a suggested implementation framework  
conta ining activities that school leadership can carry out in order to 
empower and engage parents . 
 
2.2 Pillars  of PE&E . 
The Guidelines on PE&E are premised on two pillars namely: 
empowerment and engagement.  
 
2.2.1 Parental Empowerment  
Empowerment refers to the enhancement of knowledge, s kills, 
attitudes and practices of an individual or a group in pursuit of a 
mutual goal. It is the  process of becoming stronger and more conf ident 
in performing one’s role. Therefore, parental empowerment may be 
defined as  a process or activity that is undertaken to enhanc e the 
capacity of parents so that they can actively  nurture the potential of
