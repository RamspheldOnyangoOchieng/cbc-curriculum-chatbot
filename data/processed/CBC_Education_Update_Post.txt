CBE Part 41
Core Math or Essential Math in Senior School: What is the difference?
In Grade 10, math is a choice. You either take core math to solve for the ever elusive X or you take essential math to calculate your taxes. Either way, best not to leave it to chance.
Math is no longer just math and parents need to find out whether the math their child is doing in SS will math later in life.
The choice between core mathematics and essential mathematics is one of the most critical decisions a student makes when entering Grade 10 because its going to have a significant effect on the choice of pathways later in tertiary education after Grade 12.
Both  the core and essential math are compulsory but they serve very different future goals.
A) What does core mathematics entail?
It's compulsory in the STEM track.
Its the heavy lifting needed for science &  technical fields.
It delves deep into math concepts. It's basically the Math done in 8.4.4 in secondary school.
Its aim is to prepare learners for courses in fields like  medicine, engineering, architecture, computer science, and pure sciences at all levels.
Core Math requires a strong foundation from JS.
B) What does essential math entail?
This is the utilitarian pack that targets learners in Social Sciences and the arts & sport science pathways.
It emphasizes financial literacy, statistics, and spatial reasoning etc
Instead of complex theorems, it focuses on commercial arithmetic eg business math,  data interpretation eg for research and journalism and practical geometry eg in  design.
The aim of Essential Math is to provide the learner with  mathematical survival skills needed for careers in law, business management, journalism, social work, and the arts.
It has a practical approach and it's intended to  be highly relevant to daily life.
Way forward:
Some learners are undecided on choice of pathway and future careers.
For such learners, it's better to go the core Mathematics way, thus the STEM track.
