FOREWORD
This guide gives the revised comprehensive list of textbooks and other instructional materials
which have been approved by the Ministry of Education (MoE), for use in our Secondary
Schools, covering all subjects and other areas in the curriculum. This book is organised into
five (5) sections: Section 1: Course Books for Forms 1 to 4; Section 2: Supplementary Materials;
Section 3: Reference Materials; Section 4: Dictionaries; Section 5: Other Teaching-Learning Materials.
The list contains titles on: Book Care, English, Kiswahili, Mathematics, Physics, Agriculture,
Geography, History and Government, Home Science, Computer Studies, Business Studies, Christian
Religious Education, Physical Education, Life Skills Education and General Readers. The list covers
Learners’ Course books, Teachers’ Guides and other instructional materials such as Reference Books,
Dictionaries, Atlases and Readers and Digital Content.
In this edition, a new section indicating the list of approved Literature in English and Fasihi ya Kiswahili
Set books for secondary education has been introduced. The period during which they will be in use/
studied is indicated below each title.
It should be noted that during the evaluation and vetting exercise, emphasis was laid on the quality
and relevance of the materials to the level of the Learners. In view of the this and the fact that this
curriculum calls for the authors to address issues of gender, environment, HIVand AIDS, child rights,
human rights, corruption, drug abuse, school safety, peace education and Education Sustainable
Development (ESD) among others, some changes are expected. As the changes occur, some of the
books currently in the market or in use will be rendered less appropriate.
Schools are expected to select all their books from this Approved List and ensure that they examine
the recommended books before they make their choices. The criteria and procedures are given in
the School Textbook Management Handbook. It is important that the schools stick to the approved
book policy and select only one course book per subject for each class. While the Ministry’s long term
policy is one book per pupil, it is recommended that in the short term, a ratio of 1 book per 2 pupils be
used. In institutions where books were bought four (4) years ago, there will be need to replace the old
stock in case of wear and tear.
The listing of the course books in this volume is done by Form/Level, according to the title within each
subject category of instructional materials and DOES NOT IN ANY WAY SUGGEST AN ORDER OF
PREFERENCE.
More details on secondary education books are covered under the introduction of this booklet. All
stakeholders are therefore strongly advised to carefully read the instructions given therein. In addition,
a list of bona fide booksellers which was provided by the Kenya Book Sellers Association is appended.

GENERAL INFORMATION
(A). INTRODUCTION
In order to effectively implement the Free Day Secondary Education, the MoE in consultation with
its development partners, agreed on a profile of the minimum requirements for provision of school
instructional materials. Funding is provided via School Instructional Materials Bank Accounts to every
school.
Schools have discretion over the choice of their instructional materials but will be expected to achieve
the following in their spending decisions:
 The provision of basic supplies of stationery to every student in the school
 The achievement of the basic supply targets for Each of the categories of instructional materials
as described in the Textbook Management Handbook
(B). STATUS OF THE APPROVED LIST
This Approved List of Textbooks and Other Instructional Materials, Revised 16th Edition, January
2017, contains the course books (Student’s books and Teacher’s guides) and other instructional materials
(reference books for students and Teachers, dictionaries, readers and other subject areas), which have
successfully been vetted by the Kenya Institute of Curriculum Development (KICD). The vetting process
aims at ensuring that the books follow the recommended curriculum, are of appropriate quality and
acceptable standard.
Since the evaluation held towards the end of 2005 aimed at selecting books for the New Curriculum, the
number of course books per subject and per grade has been limited to six. This is the situation found in
this edition of the Approved List for all levels of Learning.
All Public secondary schools, in Kenya are supplied with a free copy of the Approved List through their
respective CDE’s. A school can order any textbook or other instructional material that may be needed
for any class and in any subject so long as these titles/items are contained in this Approved List of
the 16th edition of 2017.
(C). LAYOUT OF THE BOOK
To make this edition of the approved list more user-friendly, it has been divided into Sections.Within
Each section, the subject / category of book titles are classified according to the following order:
(i) Class or level of Learners
 The class (e.g. Form 1) or group of Forms (e.g. Forms 1 - 2), followed by the next class in
ascending order.
 Within Each subject, the titles are arranged by Form and not by the publisher.
(ii) Course Book Materials
To make it easier for reference, the course books have been clustered into groups of subjects.
It will therefore be easier for a school to order books for a particular type of subject. These
textbooks are divided into Student’s books and Teacher’s guides.
(iii) Set Books
These have been listed and the duration when they are in use has been indicated.
(iv) Non Course book Titles
All non course book titles have been classified into the following areas;-
 Reference materials by subject for students and Teachers
 Supplementary Reading Books in English and Kiswahili
vi
 Dictionaries – English, Kamusi, French and Mathematics
 Other Teaching/Learning Support Materials including Wall charts and e-Learning materials
(D). ORDERING FOR BOOKS
Before placing orders for course books and other instructional materials, School Instructional Materials
Selection Committees (SIMSC) should first of all familiarize themselves with the contents of the
entire booklet. It is equally important that those involved in placing textbook orders should have a good
knowledge and understanding of the range of books available in the market. They should also know the
names of the publishers and authors cover prices and suitability of a given title to be purchased. It is of
utmost importance that, prior to placing textbook orders the SIMSC should familarise themselves with
the publishers’ and booksellers’ addresses and code of conduct - all provided as appendices. Schools
should order according to their needs by class and subjects.
SIMSC should make note of the distinctions between sections as follows:
Section 1: dealing with the Course book titles
Section 2: dealing with only Supplementary and Reading Materials
Section 3: dealing with all Reference Materials.
Section 4: dealing with Dictionaries
Section 5: dealing with Other Teaching Learning Materials for Teachers and pupils
Section 6 dealing with digital Content
Section 7: dealing with free materials
(i) Ordering Codes
A serial number, in ascending order, is assigned to Each title as the Ordering Code. SIMSC
must ensure that appropriate Ordering Code number is entered. However, The Ordering Code
does NOT imply merit. SIMSC should make their prudent choice.
(E). HOW SHOULD SCHOOLS SELECT THEIR INSTRUCTIONAL MATERIALS?
The Management Handbook gives a detailed step by step advice on how schools should select their
instructional materials. Nevertheless, here is a summary of the steps to be taken and the traps to avoid:
i) The Procedure
 The school should set up a School Instructional Materials Selection Committee (SIMSC) and
list the members of the committee in the Minute Book.
 Subject Teachers must be involved in selecting the books.
 The SIMSC should first make a list of the textbooks, Teachers’ guides and other instructional
materials that are already in the school so that the most urgent priorities for new books can be
decided.
 The SIMSC should study the present MoEST Approved List, or any additional circulars on the
textbooks, to determine which books and other instructional materials to purchase. It should be
noted that no books/items outside the Approved List issued by MoEST can be purchased
using funds given to schools. Beware of “false” Approved Lists: some have been known to
be in circulation by Publishers.
 When the SIMSC have all the information that they want, another SIMSC meeting should be
called to decide on the books/items to order.
 The total cost of the selected items must not be more than the budget that the school has been
allocated.
 All the decisions on selection should be recorded in the SIMSC Minute Book which must be
signed by the Secretary and the chairperson of the SIMSC.
vii
ii) Textbook selection advice and criteria
Although all the books in the MoEST Approved List have been vetted by K.I.C.D. subject panels, the
school will still need to consider the following factors in relation to their own requirements:
Syllabus Coverage
Does the content of the book fully cover the syllabus in that subject?
Does the content meet the objectives of the syllabus?
Content of Books
How appropriate is the vocabulary and general language level?
Is the presentation of topics clear and easy to understand?
Are the content and activities relevant to the children’s needs and interests?
Does the Teachers’ guide fit the needs of your Teachers? Does it provide good ideas that can be
easily introduced into classes?
Illustrations and Layout
Are the illustrations clear, appropriate and attractive?
Do they contribute to Learning?
Is the page attractively laid out?
Is the printing clear?
Is the size of the book appropriate? (e.g. large size textbooks are sometimes difficult if a school
doesn’t have enough desks and chairs for students to use)
Exercises and Activities
Are the exercises and activities clear?
Do they encourage pupils to think for themselves and apply their knowledge?
Do they contribute to the Learning process?
Are they varied?
Do they include sufficient problem-solving activities?
Are they appropriate and relevant?
Are they interesting and motivating?
Is there sufficient number of activities?
Do the activities encourage the development of different skills and attitudes?
Do the exercises/activities encourage children to work both on their own and in groups?
Price
Is the price reasonable?
Durability
How strong is the binding?
How strong is the paper and the cover?
How well is the cover finished?
Overall Assessment
What are the books’ strong points?
What are the books’ weak points?
How well do they compare with other books on the Approved List?

PART ONE
SECONDARY EDUCATION BOOKS
INTRODUCTION
THE SECONDARY EDUCATION CURRICULUM
The Secondary education curriculum was rationalized and reviewed in 2002. This entailed reorganization of
skills, concepts and knowledge in line with the revised objectives of education and it involved:
 Removal of subjects that were not found necessary for Secondary education.
 Removal of content from subjects that was found either not necessary or too advanced for the class or
level.
 Integration of related content and concepts from different subject areas.
 Infusion of pertinent emerging information and messages into appropriate subjects.
 Restating the secondary level objectives to make them clEArer and align them to the revised goals of
education.
 Relating content in all areas to the specific objectives.
THE SECONDARY CURRICULUM AT A GLANCE

NB: Physical Education (PE) is a core subject and must be taught in all classes
In view of the above, Secondary schools are expected to choose the textbooks based on the curriculum (subject
areas) they offer. It should also be noted that, the Approved List, since 2012 has incorporated course books for
General Science and Mathematics Alternative ‘B’.
NOTE:
1. At present most subjects have the maximum six titles approved. The list is however updated on
annual basis to include other titles found suitable.
2. Educational Media Programs to support the revised curriculum are being developed by the Kenya
Institute of Education.
3. Secondary Schools are advised to procure text books centrally for each class to avoid wastage and
unnecessary cost to parents. The books thus purchased become the property of the school and
can be used over a period of time by the subsequent classes.

7. Publishers will not harass or pressurize Teachers in pursuit of orders

the examination period established in writing by the publisher. All schools should be able to ask for a printed
hand-out that specifies clearly the inspection copy policy of the publisher.
