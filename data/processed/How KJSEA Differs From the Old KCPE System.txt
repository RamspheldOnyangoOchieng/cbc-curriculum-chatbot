1/20/26, 5.08 AM KJSEA Results 2025: What Every Kenyan Parent Needs to Know Before December 11 - EduPoa EDUPOA" Assessment (KJSEA) results, the first of their kind under the Competency-Based Curriculum (CBC); will be released by December 11, 2025. But this isnt just another exam result announcement: It's a litmus test for a completely new approach to learning, assessment, and school placement: For parents who grew up with KCPE, where everything hinged on a single exam day, KJSEA might feel confusing: The good news? It's actually designed to be fairer; more holistic, and less stressful. But to navigate this transition smoothly, you need to understand how it works, what to expect; and how to prepare your child for the next chapter: How KJSEA Differs From the Old KCPE System Let's start with the most important fact: KJSEA is not KCPE: Under the old system, a single exam determined your child's entire future: the school they'd attend, the opportunities they'd access, and often, the way society viewed their potential. That pressure cooker mentality is exactly what CBC aims to dismantle. KJSEA operates on a blended assessment model: Here's how the final placement score breaks down: 60% from the KJSEA exam taken at the end of Grade 9 20% from the KPSEA exam completed at the end of primary school https Iledupoa comlbloglkjsea-results-2025-what-every-kenyan-parent-needs-to-know-before-december-11/ 2/11 Blog

The Eight Achievement Levels EET (90-100%): Exceptional mastery highest placement priority EE2 (75-89%): Excellent achievement strong placement prospects MEI (58-74%): Moderate achievement good placement chances with strong SBA/KPSEA results ME2 (41-57%): Developing competence eligible for placement based on capacity AE and BE: Lower levels indicating areas requiring additional support https Iledupoa comlbloglkjsea-results-2025-what-every-kenyan-parent-needs-to-know-before-december-11/ 3/11 Blog

Dont just talk about marks Talk about pathways, interests, and futures_ Why This Moment Matters for Kenya The release of KJSEA results isn't just about 1.13 million individual learners It's a test of Kenya's commitment to educational transformation. For decades; our system judged students solely by how well performed on a single day: That approach produced anxiety, limited potential, and left countless talented young people behind: CBC, with KJSEA at its center; aims to widen that lens. It celebrates academic excellence, yes, but also creativity, consistency, problem-solving, and talent: It recognizes that learning is a journey, not a destination. And it acknowledges that every child has unique strengths worth developing: How we as parents, educators, and communities respond to these results will define whether this reform succeeds or fails If we embrace the holistic approach, support diverse pathways, and value all forms of competence, we could build an education system that truly prepares young people for life, not just exams Technology's Role in the CBC Transition https Iledupoa comlbloglkjsea-results-2025-what-every-kenyan-parent-needs-to-know-before-december-11/ 6/11 Blog your they
