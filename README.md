## 📖 Overview

The **CBC Chatbot** is a state-of-the-art Expert System designed to assist students, parents, and educators in navigating Kenya's **Competency Based Curriculum (CBC)**. Specifically focused on the critical transition to **Grade 9 (Senior School)**, the system provides accurate, document-backed guidance on:

*   **Career Pathways**: STEM, Social Sciences, and Arts & Sports Science.
*   **Subject Selection**: Mandatory vs. Elective subjects for each pathway.
*   **Assessment Guidelines**: How KICD and KNEC assess learner progress.

Unlike generic AI, this system uses **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** to ground every answer in official Ministry of Education circulars and KICD curriculum designs, ensuring zero hallucinations on policy matters.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🤖 Intelligent Chat Assistant
*   **Powered by Llama 3.3 (via Groq)** for ultra-fast, natural reasoning.
*   **Context-Aware**: Remembers full conversation history.
*   **Fact-Checked**: Citations from uploaded PDFs are used to formulate answers.

### 📚 Dynamic Knowledge Base
*   **Upload & Forget**: Admins can upload new official PDFs via the web interface.
*   **Auto-Ingestion**: The system automatically extracts text, chunks it, embeds it, and updates the global Vector Database.
*   **Cloud Native**: Uses **Chroma Cloud** so that knowledge updates are instantly available to all users without redeploying code.

### 🎨 Premium User Experience
*   **Modern UI**: Built with **Next.js 15**, TailwindCSS, and Framer Motion.
*   **Kenyan Aesthetic**: Custom "Outfit" typography and vibrant, localized color palettes.
*   **Responsive**: Fully optimized for mobile phones (where most parents access it) and desktops.

## 🏗️ Architecture

The system employs a **Dual-Service Architecture** to balance performance and capability:

```mermaid
graph LR
    User[User / Browser] -->|Interacts| Frontend[Next.js Frontend (Vercel)]
    Frontend -->|Queries| Groq[Groq AI API]
    Frontend -->|Retrieves Context| Chroma[Chroma Cloud DB]
    
    User -->|Uploads PDF| Frontend
    Frontend -->|Forwards File| Backend[Python FastAPI Service (Render)]
    Backend -->|Processes & Embeds| Chroma
```

1.  **Frontend (Vercel)**: Handles the UI, Chat Logic, and direct RAG retrieval.
2.  **Backend (Render)**: A specialized Python worker that handles heavy lifting—PDF parsing, OCR (future), and generating embeddings for the Vector DB.
